<h4>
        How Game 1 Works:
</h4>

<p>
        You will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant.
        In this game, one of you will be Participant 1 and the other
        Participant 2. Prior to making a decision, you will learn your role,
        which will be randomly assigned. There are <strong>{{ Constants.endowment }}</strong>
        to split. Participant 1 will decide how much she or he will retain.
        Then the rest will go to Participant 2. <strong> So the more Participant 1 keeps,
        the less Participant 2 gets </strong>.

<p>
        In addition, each player will also be randomly allocated an initial endowment
        which will either be 10, 100, or 300 points. Each player has an equal probability
        of receiving each of the initial endowments, and your initial endowment is yours
        to keep regardless of the income split decision. You will learn what your
        initial endowment is before the game starts, as well as the endowment of your
        anonymous partner.
</p>

<h4>
        Points and Payoffs:
</h4>

<p>
         The total amount of points you earn in Game 1 is equal to your initial endowment plus your income split from
         Participant 1â€™s decision. <strong> Total points (Game 1) = initial endowment + income split </strong>.
         For your convenience, these instructions will remain available to you on all subsequent screens of this game.
